I've been away for about a month traveling across four different countries, including Singapore, Bali, Paris, and Switzerland. The past few days back home made me realize how much I'd missed my friends, my dog, and the city. After being abroad for so long, I've concluded that there is really no place like New York. It might not be for everyone, but I personally can't see myself living elsewhere in the long-term---at least for now.

Yesterday I met with some of my best friends from Columbia. At this point we've all graduated, and are either already settling into our postgrad lives or about to enter our full-time jobs. One of the highlights of the day was chugging a huge glass bottle of chocolate milk at Essex Market. It reminded me of the chocolate milk I had in Zürich, which was one of the few items I could find on the cheaper end. We passed the bottle around the table as though we were playing a drinking game, each of us taking a swig of milk when it got to our turn. It was lowkey gross thinking about the backwash left by each of our mouths, but we finished the milk anyway so that one of my friends could get back his $1 deposit for the bottle. It ended up being, in his words, a "crusty dollar." But hey, at least he got his money back. (If you're reading this, I'll have you know that I still think you liked the boobie soap more than the abs).

One of the funniest quotes I heard from my friend was, "I think we need to tone down mental health awareness. I think we need to stop being so aware." (It was funnier when he said it in person). As much as I advocate for reducing the stigma of mental health, I think he somewhat has a point. Reflecting on mental health and sharing heartfelt experiences is great and all, but doing it excessively gets kind of tiring. As you've probably already noticed, this isn't a conventional blog where I share what I've been up to each week. It might not seem like it, but blogging requires a good amount of mental energy and thinking. And sometimes, I just don't want to think.

Later that day, when I actually did get drunk off a lychee soju drink in a Capri-Sun pouch, my friend convinced me that the coffee beans that came with our check were edible. And then I tried eating it, and when I realized he was joking the moment the waitress stopped me, I threw a coffee bean into my friend's earhole from the other side of the table. I learned that 1) I am truly a lightweight and 2) I can do impressive things with unprecedented accuracy one drink in.
