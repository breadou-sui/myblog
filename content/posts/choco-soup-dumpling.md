ur like a chocolate soup dumpling <br>
tasty & normal-looking on the outside <br>
questionably delicious..?? on the inside <br>

truth be told, you're something i've never had <br>
i can only imagine what you are like <br>
based on externalities, to my distaste <br>
for i am never one to judge from appearances <br>

you're talked about a lot <br>
attention trails you wherever you go <br>
u defy convention with grace <br>
teach me how to be like you... wait <br>

is that what i really want? <br>
no, what i really want is this<br>

i want to dig my tongue into the folds of your skin<br>
but you're starting to get cold <br>
should i let you shrivel up <br>
or warm you up in the steamer my kitchen holds? <br>

i know i'll want more <br>
after the first bite <br>
i know i can always order more <br>
but none of them will be the same as you, my first

now you're staring at me coldly on my plate <br>
engraved in the memory of my insatiable appetite <br>
i don't want to eat you anymore, i say as i turn away <br>
the head of a picky eater, with a pout so uptight

i don't like overly sweet things, i claim <br>
yet you're the one i crave <br>
im self-conscious of my daily intake <br>
but i'd eat you a million times no matter how much ill weigh<br>

recently i've realized <br>
i can't have my chocolate soup dumpling and eat it too <br>
i knew it all along <br>
but the truth still kinda hurts <br>

just a little bit, i say <br>
i've been through this i'm ok
