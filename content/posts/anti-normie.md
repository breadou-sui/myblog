L: "Omg so weird. This account is literally the opposite of a normie."

A: "HAHAHA it's like that RISD girl on Hinge. "Brush teeth with me?""

L: "So many RISD girls are like this. Okay but like, I seriously cannot deal with normies."

A: "How would you define a normie?"

L: "It's just someone who's really mainstream and unoriginal. Like they'll put on this social image and make friends exclusively with people who have clout to elevate their social status."

A: "Omg it's like when you scroll through their Instagram photos and see like 10 different people in each photo but then you wonder who their actual friends are."

L: "Okay, like every time I've interacted with a [censored job title] I always get the sense that they're being superficially nice when in reality it feels like they're hiding this underlying motive of trying to see if they can get something out of you. I don't know how it is at your school, but it's a huge problem here. I guess it makes sense that they act like that because it's straight up what they do for a living." 

A: "I haven't interacted with enough of them to draw any conclusions, but I always hear them complaining about the number of hours they work each week."

L: "Yeah like what do you even do all day? Paperwork? Bitch you literally do Excel."

A: "Bitches be like "this shit can't be automated I needa work overtime and make the numbers of sleep I'm lacking into a competition so people know how hard my life is" while posting pictures of themselves at the club every two days."

L: "Omg for real though."

A: "Bitches be like, "I can't walk the same way as you even though we live in the same direction because I have nothing to gain from you so bye!""

L: "Girl yeah like I was literally telling you about that incident... Bitches think they original but they be playing cookie cutter."

A: "We're such bitches for cracking these jokes. At least we're authentic bitches. We're... what's the right word?"

L: "We're genuine."

A: "That's it. Bitches be saying the kind of shit we do and goin' like "no offense but!""

L: "HAHAHA!!"

A: "Girl there is literally no originality on this platform anymore. Okay, here's my theory. People are either normies or trying too hard to be anti-normies to the point where they follow only girls with anti-normie feeds." 

L: "But then because they end up being influenced by those girls, their aesthetic ends up looking the same." 

A: "Exactly. So people should just be themselves. But when people are just themselves on Instagram, they don't get as many likes unless they fit into that category of quirky anti-normie aesthetic. People don't wanna see art that isn't good. And that standard of good is a bar set by our society."

L: "Yeah... everything on this platform is all just for show."

A: "I'm telling you, bitches needa update their fucking Excel. Like learn some Python so you can stop being the snake."

A: "Aight, I'm gonna head out to my meeting. Hopefully you won't ever have to deal with those kinds of experiences again."

L: "Yeah... every time I see a normie I'm just gonna walk away."

A: "Honestly that's the move. No one deserves to be treated like that. Okay I gotta go byeeee <3"

L: "Bye girlieee!!"
