<h3>this is your brain on climate change</h3>
<i>
Hey mom, where are we? <br>
I see meteorites. <br>

When I look up, there is fire in the sky. <br>
It reminds me of when we rode those human-built wings every summer <br>
to see Âß®Âß® and ÂßêÂßê and ËàÖËàÖ <br>
and Âß•Âß• and Áà∑Áà∑, who are no longer with us. <br>

Perhaps they're watching over us <br>
from the angle of the stars <br>
like Polaris, to guide us quietly <br>
when the world never stops spinning. <br>

I remember the way the colors of the sky changed 
on our 13-hour flight. <br>
Sometimes streaks of orange and pink, <br>
sometimes the boring shade of indigo, <br>
and the plea of the flight attendant <br>
to roll the window down while the rest of us were fast asleep.

If I was lucky, I could see the clouds from above. <br>
I've always wanted a pair of wings of my own <br>
so that I could see that sight whenever I wanted <br>
instead of counting down the days until July <br>

So that I could break that glass barrier between nature and I, <br>
that manmade barrier our neighbors never cease to speak of. <br>
But truthfully, I would be like Icarus <br>
flying too close to places I shouldn't venture <br>

Mom, please tell me the truth. <br>
Are we on a different planet? <br>
I won't get mad if the answer is yes---I promise. <br>

Why has the sky changed? <br>
When I look up, I am no longer <br>
reminded of those summer days <br>

The movement of the clouds is not benign <br>
The longer I wait, the less the stars shine <br>
Orion, Perseus, Ursa Major <br>
It's getting harder to find these childhood friends of mine

Have I always been drawn to <br>
those artificial entities that have led to our destruction? <br>
Is it selfish of me <br>
To beg for a way for us to coexist? <br>

I never liked December to begin with. <br>
You would always get sad around the holidays <br>
because it's just you, me, and Dad here <br>
gathering food by ourselves in those dark winter nights.

But now it's you, me, and Dad <br>
against the rest of the world <br>
This world that was once so beautiful <br>
Our world known as Earth

I wish that we could be with the rest of our family <br> 
I want things to be the way they used to be <br>
Is that so much to ask?
