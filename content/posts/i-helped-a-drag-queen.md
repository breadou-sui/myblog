A couple of summers ago, a best friend of mine brought me to an invite-only event at the Met. I don't remember the name of the event---I'm not even sure if there was one---but I do remember Alan Cumming and his neon pink suit, Taylor Swift's <i>You Need To Calm Down</i> blasting through the bushes on the rooftop, and lots of chaotic gay energy. It was fuckin' awesome.

At one point, my best friend M and I had to use the restroom. It was a located on a fancy private floor with cream marble walls, a part of the Met I'd never seen before. I remember coming out of the stall and seeing a large figure from behind struggling to zip up their dress. "Excuse me---could you help me with this?"

Her bright red lipstick stood out against her dark wig and black gown. She seemed to be out of breath and in a hurry. M and I got her up and about in seconds.

The drag queen we helped turned out to be one of the performers at the event. Her singing was off-key and bursting with exuberant confidence. I don't remember the exact speeches she gave, except for the fact that my cheeks hurt from all the laughing, rooting, and for once feeling comfortable in the sexuality that I had kept denying for years. 

I also remember the intimidation and excitement from being in a horde of expressive adults who were so different from the ones I was surrounded with growing up, as well as the political satire against big corporations and anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. Oh, and don't forget the rainbows. The whole party felt like a dream. A dream that would've been even better if Coco Peru were there. I would've brought her tension tamer tea so she wouldn't have to drive all the way to Target only to discover that it's out of stock.

Now, if only I could remember the name of the drag queen I met. It was a really funny name too...
