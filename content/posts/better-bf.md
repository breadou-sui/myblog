Hello there, pretty girl 🥴👋💦 Where ya headin'? 😏 Oh, to the club 🚕 with your ✨boyfriend✨? 🙄 You should dump him 🚮 <i>ahora mismo</i> ⏱️ I bet he's a walking red flag 🚩🚩😬 and that you're giving him way too many chances because you're too nice 🙄 so now I'm going to list some reasons why you should choose <i>me</i>🤙 over that douchebag 🗑️ whose weenie is prolly this big 🤏 and inversely proportional to his ego 🙈 I can recommend him my signature dick extenders 🍆 to quote my friend it's like a hat for your dick 🎩 

<h3>1. I'm An Intellectual 📚</h3>
Yea I got that 🌿 Ivy League bachelor's degree in computer science 👩‍💻 with former ✨head teaching assistant✨ experience 👩‍🏫 and recently graduated with a teaching award 🏆 no matter how much I shitpost about my assignments 📄 on Instagram 📸 the WORK 👏 GETS 👏 DONE 👏 BABY 👶 rest assured my professors can vouch for my intelligence 💯 #womenintech #girlboss 🔝 not to mention I went to the same high school as Audre Lorde 🏫 #lowkeyflex 💪 surely I can write AND code ✏️ I'm not like the rest of the tech bros 😤 so won't you pretty plz give me a chance? 🥺

<h3>2. I'm Employed 💳</h3>
I am soon-to-be corporate slave 💻 who will bring you to the deluxe office with an unlimited gelato station 🍨 and bar 🥂 and free swag you'll need an IKEA bag to carry 🛍️ I will let you swipe my card like 花儿乐队's 洗刷刷💸 使劲的刷🤑😘😜🧽 I work hard AND deliver results baby 📈 #amazonleadershipprinciples #stonks #dogecoin 

<h3>3. I'm Attractive 🔥</h3>
Yes pretty privilege is a thing because I have the privilege to make <i>you,</i> m'lady, fall for me 😘 with my alluring gaze 👁️👄👁️ and flirtatious smile 👅💦 your babies will be the hottest generation alive 💁 even if we get into an argument 💥 at least you can argue 🤬 while staring at a sexy face 👩‍🦳 perhaps we can do a lil smth afterwards to make up for it 🥵🥴😵🍑👩‍❤️‍👩 only if u want to 😏🛀

<h3>4. I Know The Best Date Spots In The City 🌃</h3>
As a native New Yorker I know all of the tourist scams 🙅‍♀️ and where the real spots are at 🍷 none of that Joe's Shanghai shit 🥟 or creepy Times Square Elmos snatching your hard-earned bucks 💵 sure the Met's great but kinda basic after a while 🏛️ tbh there are many museums I haven't gone to either... let's experience them together? 😊 trust me my Yelp collections are ready for all your cuisine cravings 🍱🍝🍤

<h3>5. 您的homegirl可以讲中文 🇨🇳</h3>

<h3>6. I Will Not Overstep Boundaries ❌</h3>
I will not ask you to text me 24/7 📆 nor share your location with me 📍 nor will I snatch your phone 📱 and block all of your guy friends on Snapchat 🚫 If you don't text me back within a day I will probably think about it 💭 but I only ask that you communicate ✅ about your insecurities™️ though I understand it can be hard 😔 but I will always <3 u no matter what 🤗 as long as you are honest to me 🙊 which is a trait that is surprisingly hard to find nowadays... 🤨🤥🤡

<h3>7. I Can Dye Your Hair 💈</h3>

<h3>8. I Have A Hypoallergenic Miniature Poodle 🐩</h3>
He is a real-life teddy bear 🧸 and can understand Chinese and English commands 🇨🇳🇺🇸 he can provide emotional support when I'm not home 🐕‍🦺 but keep in mind he does get jealous very easily 🐶 who knows maybe you'll be jealous of him 😳


<br>

In all honesty, these are sort of generic qualities that can really be fulfilled by anyone if they tried hard enough. But I'm confident in myself 😎 which makes me harder to catch 🤓 cos I know I'm a catch 😌 and I hope you are not reading into this post too seriously because it is highkey cringe 😬 but at least I know I am being ironic 🤭 for the purposes of making you laugh 🤗 cuz ur smile is the prettiest thing I've seen all day 😉 now that was smooth wasn't it 😁🧼	 careful not to slip on my slick words but even if you fall I'll catch you 🧺 bet your boyfriend can't do that cause he's too busy watching hentai on your work laptop 🙄🤧🙃 soo... text me when ur free? xoxo 💋
