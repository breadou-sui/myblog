Take the <span style="color: red">r</span><span style="color: orange">a</span><span style="color: #f0d529">i</span><span style="color: #42cf50">n</span><span style="color: #4294cf">b</span><span style="color: #ae83eb">o</span><span style="color: #e876e2">w</span> whisk and b̶̪̲̣̺̣͈̹͐̒́e̶̗̓ạ̵̝͠t̷͎̞̳͎̞̀̋̇ͅ egg white until it's shiny, fluffy, and deprived of pain. <i>don't stop...</i><br>
4. Slowly pour 1/2 cup of sugar into the bowl and continue b̶̪̲̣̺̣͈̹͐̒́e̶̗̓ạ̵̝͠ting until stiff teardrop-shaped peaks form. <br>
5. Poke into the mixture using an index finger and tap the tip of your tongue. <br>
6. Dip highlighter brush into bowl using non-dominant hand. <br> 
7. Bring your brush to the 8.5" x 11" paper and close your eyes. <br>
8. Draw the first thing that comes to mind. <br>
9. Open your eyes. <br>
10. Take a photo of your drawing using the Canon EOS Rebel T7. <br>
11. Upload the photo onto Instagram with your iOS 12.0+ device. <br>
12. Come back to this step the next time you're feeling sad. <br>
13. Cry into the bunny ears contact lens case. <br>
14. What's the worst thing someone's ever done to you? <br> 

																												. . . 
It's okay. You don't have to tell me. Shatter the screen of your iOS device instead. <br>
16. Marinate the glass shards in your tears for however long you want. <br>
17. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of sugar into each hole of the contact lens case. <br>
18. Put the cap back onto the bunny contact lens case. <br>
19. Grasp the bunny contact lens case tightly in your fist. <br>
20. When you start feeling heat emanate from your palm, gently count from 12 to -12. <br>
21. Open the bunny contact lens case. See how the glass shards have melted into rainbow contact lens? Why not put 'em on! <br>
22. Take your sharpie and do a sharp winged eyeliner on both of your eyelids. <br>
23. Face your Canon EOS Rebel T7 towards the shattered iOS device lying on the ground and set a timer. <br>
24. Smile into the shattered screen of your iOS device from above until you hear the camera click. <br>
25. Clean up the remainder of the mess using the vacuum. <br>
26. Eat the last egg in whatever style you want. You can even make an egg tart out of it with the leftover sugar. You deserve it. <br>
