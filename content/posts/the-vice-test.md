<i>Whew. That was a lot. Let's take a deep breath. 3... 2... 1... Now for the evaluation. 

I don't need to give you a score to quantify how messed up our society can be sometimes. 

Look, we all make mistakes. Some of which are more forgivable than others. But there are people who will check off some of the more problematic items thinking that what they're doing is totally fine. People in authority, people who have the means to project their voice loudly while silencing others, and people who you would never once suspect in your life.

You know who you are. Indulge in your fucking ignorance. Bathe in the bliss of your self-destructive veil. 

A smile is not consent. Age does not justify your actions. Some giggles are an instinctual protective mechanism. 

Yet here you are thinking that everything you did was okay. That people are always so easy to read, because of course everything on the outside is reflective of who they are on the inside. And you wonder why they stopped responding to your messages. Why they avert your gaze while passing by you in the hallway. Why everyone ruled out your candidacy when everybody else seemed to love you and the jokes you made. 

You stand there in shock, but you've never once questioned whether what you were doing was acceptable. Yeah, you. You fucked up. Now listen to this voice in your head that grew out of the voices you suppressed. The voice inspired by literary figures like Audre Lorde and Cathy Park Hong. The voice of my peers and friends. My voice. 

Some of you probably read this and felt bad at times. Don't worry, I did too. Everyone's done at least a couple of these. That's actually part of the point of this quiz. You feeling this way means that you, at least to some extent, hold yourself accountable to some moral standard however defined. I think it would've been more problematic if you didn't experience the mix of emotions that you felt. Now you know what to improve on. That is, if you choose to change. But if not, I respect your decision. Maybe. It depends.

We're all dicks in the end, but at least this test gives you an idea of how tall your metaphorical dick stands in relation to others. Size doesn't matter as long as you're a "good" person on the inside, right? How do you even define "good" nowadays? That's up to you to decide.

On a brighter note, thank you to the people who contribute to making this world a better place in your own unique individual ways. Even just keeping some of these points in the back of your mind means something. I hope that you will continue educating yourself on some of these topics, because I certainly am still learning and have plenty to thank the ones I look up to for.
