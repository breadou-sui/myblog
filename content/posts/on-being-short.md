<h3> 1. I can't see behind people's heads during concerts. </h3>
I cannot see a thing unless I sit on top of someone's shoulders. Back when I was a little kid, I could just ask my dad to pick me up and hold my Häagen Dazs banana split at the same time. But now I can't just climb up the shoulders of some rando I've never met, nor do I get free banana splits every weekend anymore. I'll just vibe in the darkness, I guess. <i>Hello darkness, my old friend... </i> 😢

<h3> 2. It's harder for me to assert my dominance. 💢</h3>
Imagine a 158cm girl clenching her fists at someone who's five heads taller than her. Who's the more intimidating one here? It's like the way Taiga bickers with Ryuuji from Toradora. And then the most annoying feeling is WHEN THE PERSON TALLER THAN ME PATS MY HEAD 🤬

<h3> 3. I need to stand on a stairwell to kiss tall people. </h3>
How do you kiss tall people when both of you are standing without making it awkward? The nice thing though is that it's more surprising when the shorter person kisses the taller one because it happens so rarely. The conclusion is that short people kisses should be cherished more. smoooch 😘 —xoxo

<h3> 4. I can't reach the subway pole on the ceiling. 🚃</h3>
If I get pushed to the middle of the car (which is more than often the case), I am doomed to straining my arm and leg muscles from tippy-toeing towards the ceiling pole. I'm not a very touchy person, so I usually don't cling onto people unless I've known them for a long time. So what do I do? Ride the MTA like it's a fucking longboard.

<h3> 5. I need a chair to hoist myself up my dorm bed. 🛌</h3>
I kid you not, sometimes I need to use my chair as an intermediary stool to get onto my bed. I'm not sure why the dorm beds are raised so high, but I'm too scared to adjust the height myself. Imagine making out with someone and you're both getting super into it, and then all of a sudden you're like "sorry can you lift me up onto the bed?" And if you're too heavy for them to lift you, you needa pull this unsexy one-legged karate pose with your dominant leg and hoist your entire body up using your knee. That is, if your knee can even reach the bed. Or you could just roll the chair over. Or maybe they're into the karate pose, you never know 😉

<h3> 6. I can't wear certain dresses or pants unless I get them tailored. 👗</h3>
<i> OMG that maxi dress is soo cute... wait jk it's taller than I am... ok how abt these grunge pants they look so bomb holy shit! Lemme check out this Youtuber's review... "So if you're short and don't own platform boots, these pants will definitely drag on the ground." </i> ;-; 

<h3> 7. I need to take more steps to match the walking pace of a taller person. </h3>
I literally feel like I'm jogging while walking alongside some of my friends who are nearly 6 feet tall. I love talking to you but I need you to wait for me to catch up, pls. Also I need to strain my neck to talk to you sometimes but our friendship makes it worth :')

<h3> 8. I can't reach the snacks on the top shelf of the supermarket. </h3>
I REALLY WANT THAT MINT CHOCO POCKY BUT IT'S ALL THE WAY UP THE TOP SHELF AND I'M TOO SOCIALLY AWKWARD TO ASK THE EMPLOYEE FOR HELP I JUST WANTED TO BUY THIS POCKY LEAVE H-MART AND CALL IT A DAY PLS WHY YOU GOTTA PUT IT ALL THE WAY UP HTERE PLz

<h3> 9. I can squeeze into tight spaces. </h3>
u try to block my way not only will i find a way to get to u but i will also block u and ur sorry a$$ after i finish u off yea u wot m8??

<h3> 10. I meet the minimum threshold height needed to become an astronaut. </h3>
If I ever fly off to space like Jeff Bezos without his uh... like, everything... I'll be grateful for this.

<h3> 11. You'd be surprised at the number of adults who treat me as a kid on first sight. </h3>
I'm talking about settled middle-aged close-minded adults who think I lack emotional maturity because of how short I am, combined with the fact that the way I look and the makeup and clothes I wear make me look like a chibi anime character advertised on an otaku web store.

Don't talk to me like I'm a kid who isn't aware of what you're thinking. And on a related note, don't judge someone by the clothes they wear or how they look. You're the one who needs to grow the fuck up. <br>

Once you do, come back and take a seat. We'll have an intellectual discussion where we sit down at a coffee table staring at each other at the same height, and I'll talk to you all about the Oedipal Complex in Haruki Murakami's <i>Kafka On The Shore</i>, that time I met David Sedaris at The Strand, and the relationship between mathematics and murder in <i>The Devotion of Suspect X</i>.
