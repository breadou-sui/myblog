I am literally on the verge of buying a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/902082399/chicken-purse-including-legs-and-neck?click_key=6ff8b02cfd5db934f1435437bcf53f746329bff1%3A902082399&click_sum=3c5db920&ref=shop_home_recs_1&crt=1"> chicken purse üêî</a> right now. At first, when I opened the Etsy shop's listing, I thought to myself, "Who in the world would buy this?" That was before I became enamored of the chicken purse within the next two minutes. It's fucking adorable. 

After losing my wallet for the first time recently, I now know not to bring open tote bags into a bustling bar at 3:00 a.m.---especially if the bar is loud, has a long bathroom line, and is filled with dim lighting. Thankfully, I didn't have much in there, but if you're wondering what led me to that chicken purse page, this is one of the reasons.

I've been busy settling into the *real* adult post-grad life. I started work, joined an awesome team with a group of incredible people, and expanded my drinking palette ever so slightly with said group of people. I learned through the hard way that mezcal tastes like a tire or, as one of my colleagues remarked on a better-sounding note, a smoky piece of burnt wood. One of my teammates introduced me to this bar with a pineapple rum drink called Frothy Girl, and I much prefer that instead. (Also it was light pink and looked very cute and frothy)

I dyed my hair a dark brown recently in hopes that it'll fade lighter over time the more I wash it. I chose not to continue with silver this time even though I really liked it, mainly because my hair has undergone excessive damage in my past two sessions. The other reason is that I've been getting mild allergic reactions during the bleaching process, and I don't want to risk a shit ton of scalp irritation when it's only been a couple months since my last appointment. Honestly, I feel like lighter hair suits me better, so even I'm taking some time getting used to this new version of myself in the mirror. But I'll go back to pink and silver eventually in no time!

I find myself having way more free time than I did back in undergrad, and a part of me is not used to this feeling at all. I feel relieved that I don't have to grind for exams and PSETs each week anymore, but at the same time, there's this itchy feeling of wanting to do something productive in that spare time and feeling guilty for not having done anything. It's a strange duality that I'm still trying to figure out. 

Anyway, I'm about to do some more traveling in the upcoming month, which is wild considering that I've just come back from a month-long summer trip abroad. I feel like I'm living my best life right now, and I can't express how grateful I am to be where I am today. Also, special shoutout to a special someone---if you're reading this, wanna get some chicken nuggs? :)
