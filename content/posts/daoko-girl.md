Welcome to my analysis of GIRL by Japan Animator Expo---one of the most beautiful music animations in existence. Over 5 years have passed since its release, but I still find myself awestruck by its beauty in the same way I did when I first watched it in high school. The merging of 2D and 3D perspectives, the psychedelic colors so dreamy and gentle to the touch, the isolated atmosphere that flings you out of this planet and into the self-constructed world of a lonely girl...

GIRL is a sequel (though its plot reads more like a prequel) to ME!ME!ME! by TeddyLoid, which is another work of social commentary that I might analyze in a future post. The song is split into two halves A and B. For now, I'm only going to focus on part A since there's a rich amount of material to be covered there.

There's no denying that the animation is filled with sexual imagery from the start. The animation opens up with the protagonist sitting in a boat shaped like a clitoris.

Initially, she appears in a Japanese schoolgirl uniform with one arm draped over her head. The following lyrics accompany her transformation into a magical girl:

<i>
	Everything I touch crumbles down in this imaginary world <br>
	How many times have I rebuilt it? <br>
	I've waited for so long that my body became skilled <br>
	From the other side of the moon
</i>

</div>

Colorful cosmetics, stripped underwear, <i> "body became skilled..." </i> Put in the context of society, it's clear that there's some form of sexual exchange going on---or more precisely, as <a href="https://incomputers.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/daoko-girl-an-analysis-pt-1/"> Niki claims in her analysis</a>---<i>enjo k≈çsai</i>, a term that describes a transactional relationship in which middle-aged men will compensate young women with money for companionship and often sexual favors in return. 

The girl is surrounded by forms of material wealth, including makeup, heels, and lingerie. She sits in a seductive outfit with a mysterious expression, staring directly at the viewer with a calm, fixated gaze. The audience is plucked out of reality and lands in an unfamiliar yet enchanting place. Dare I say we even find ourselves enjoying this momentary pause in the lyrics. What did we do to deserve a scene so beautiful?

	<p><img src="/daoko-girl-universe.png" alt="daoko-universe" width="95%"/></p>
</div>

As viewers, we find ourselves immersed in the world that the protagonist creates. It's almost like the Garden of Eden from <i>Genesis</i>, except in the animation, the protagonist doesn't actually eat the forbidden fruit. Rather, she takes a bite out of it and spits out the pieces. 

<div id="girl-apple-section" style="margin-left: 60px">
	<p><img src="/daoko-apple-animated.gif" alt="daoko-eating-apple" width="95%"/></p>
</div>

By refusing to eat the apple, our protagonist denies the truth behind her fantasy and ultimately chooses her own universe over reality. Perhaps this moment alludes to the way teenage girls nowdays often wish to classify themselves as being different from the dating norm (I say this because I've been there myself). They present themselves as "quirky" to become more likeable, engage in riskier behavior to draw attention, and seek pleasure in an independent routine that, at first sight, seems to be fun. In short, they assert their individuality by resisting the image of the "good," "innocent" girl they're expected to become.

<div id="girl-prince-section" style="margin-left: 60px; margin-top: 20px">
	<p><img src="/daoko-horse.png" alt="daoko-prince" width="95%"/></p>
</div>

Although many participants of <i>enjo k≈çsai</i> will perceive their actions to be a form of empowerment, what individuals tend not to realize---as feminist Chizuko Ueno notes in her article "Self-determination on sexuality?"---is that they're reinforcing the very structures that uphold the patriarchical society by using their body to serve the male desire. Like an illusory trap set up by the escapee themselves, with who to blame?

<div id="girl-underwear-section" style="margin-left: 60px; margin-top: 20px">
	<p><img src="/daoko-underwear.png" alt="daoko-underwear" width="95%"/></p>
</div>

The world that keeps destroying itself. The prince charming that doesn't exist. The masturbatory indulgence that leaves a bitter taste in the aftermath.

I think that the protagonist is searching for something that deep down, she knows she's never going to find. She rebuilds the self-constructed fantasy world of so-called love over and over again, only to watch it crumble down, collapse, and disintegrate. What <i>enjo k≈çsai</i> provides is not stability, but rather a cyclic means of fantastical pleasure that is rendered void by reality.

The next time you see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0df7k__KEHw&t=421s"> YouTube video</a> titled "Japan's Schoolgirl Pin-Ups" in your recommendations, or witness the way older men stare at 13-year-old idol Sakurai Yune with their suggestive gifts after her show, how does that make you really feel about this "just" society we live in?

<i>
	I love, I love, I love... I want to know <br>
	I love, I love, I love... I'm in love <br>
	I love, I love, I love... I lost my love.
</i>
