Google search time. I feel like a creeper doing this but it's 'kay cause I'm in incognito mode ðŸ˜Ž Don't autocorrect me, Google!!! Oh wait lol there's a Stanford admissions reader with the same name as her. I wonder if she knows. I could use it as a conversation starter. Wait, but then she'd know I looked her up... 

Omg her anime aesthetic is soo cute. She could be my 3D waifuu~~ Let's take a quick peek at her timeline. She doesn't have any relationship info... wait my friend who's friends with her on FB says she's married to this one person... who tf is this?? they don't even have a profile pic... some competition <i> you </i> are lol

It's been three days and she still hasn't accepted my friend request. I wonder if she isn't as active on FB? I'll just wait for now. At least I have other platforms to see her pretty face.
