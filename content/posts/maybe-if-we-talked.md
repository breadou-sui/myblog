maybe if we talked about it <br>
we would have the courage to speak up <br>

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we would get the help we need <br>

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we wouldn't associate therapy with shame <br>

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we wouldn't feel the need to hide <br>

maybe if we talked about it <br>
our words would no longer be suffocated by tears <br>

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we would have healthier coping mechanisms 

maybe if we talked about it <br>
you wouldn't rely on sight to see if we're okay

maybe if we talked about it <br>
things would be a lot easier

maybe if we talked about it <br>
our voices would sound different

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we wouldn't stutter

maybe if we talked about it <br>
we'd have other things to worry about

如果我们谈了这个事情 <br>
我们的想法就不会这么落后
