if only she were normal <br>
you think <br>
to yourself <br>

pretty girl with <br>
a pretty face <br>
quirky personality <br>
decked with lace <br>

eye candy <br>
full of grace <br>
walks fast <br>
at her own pace <br>

if only she were normal <br>
they say <br>

bitter dolly <br>
prolly mixed race <br>
filled with mischief <br>
leaves no trace

corrupted mind <br>
takes up space <br>
too much skin <br>
what a disgrace <br>

if only i were normal <br>
i think to myself <br>

gazing into <br>
hyperspace <br>
flooded with thoughts <br>
i can't erase

"whatcha doin?" <br>
concentrate <br>
don't touch <br>
it's my escape <br>

if only i were normal <br>
but i don't wanna be <br>
i can't be <br>
so leave me be
