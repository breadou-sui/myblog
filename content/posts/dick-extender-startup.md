A: "Okay, so I was sitting at the bar right. And then all of a sudden the guys around me start talking about their dick sizes relative to an iPhone."

L: "Omg men... Wait how does that even work??"

A: "They just stacked up the iPhone against itself and compared their dick size to that."

L: "Wait they had to stack?? That's actually so long."

A: "Ok I doubt that's actually the case. But one of them did say theirs is the length of the latest iPhone."

L: "Okay I think that's a good size. Like it's not too small and not too big."

A: "Omg asdfjkl HAHAHA wait girl what if people just made dick extensions. Then nobody would have to worry about size anymore. Are those a thing already??"

L: "Wait you mean like a hat for your dick? That's such a good idea."

A: "Right?? Do those exist? If it doesn't then it should."

L: "Omg that should totally exist. It could be your side hustle."

A: "We'll be working at the biggest tech companies and then when people ask us what we do outside of work..."

L: "They'd be like <i>What's your side hustle?</i> Oh nothing much I just make dick extenders!"

A: "LOOOOOOOOOOL ok wait what if the dick extenders were automated? Like you could control the length using a remote control, so it's never too big or too small. You could adjust how long based on your partner's preferences."

L: "That's actually such a good idea. You know this would make such an interesting project if you really think about it."

A: "What makes you say that?"

L: "Well, because there's so many components involved. You have to think about the materials that'd simulate the most realistic sensation, what kinds of customers would be using your product..."

A: "Omg this is actually a problem space that hasn't been tackled enough. We should just build a dick extender startup."

L: "For real though. So many people would use our products."

A: "We'd make billions. The porn industry needs us."

L: "You could start off with a blueprint."

A: "Wait straight up you wanna make one?"

L: "I'd actually be down."

A: "Let's do it."
