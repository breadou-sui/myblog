one day i founded a secret space <br>
where no one could tell me what i can and cannot do <br>
safe zone for little i's <br>
shit that don't make sense to you <br>

a place where i can write whatever i want <br>
however i want ... --- / -... . / .. - <br>
prose, poetry, lyrics, sound, run-on sentences all around <br>
iambic 无数meter—你管不着 <br>

when i was a kid <br>
i got tired of being <br>
so hyperaware of my own voice <br>
and how it affected my audience <br>

u wanna be a scholar <br>
don't use passive voice <br>
no i's or we's or but's <br>
though in the end it's your voice <br>

Times New Roman <br> 
12 pt font <br>
1-inch margins <br>
MLA citations <br>

thesis arguable <br>
topic sentences debatable <br>
u wanna survive as a writer <br>
then conform to these rules <br>

yeah, perhaps ur right <br>
but i think at one pt we all need to<br>
stop the bullshit <br>
of pretending like we're not human <br>

like u don't feel things like any other individual <br>
like u don't wanna break out of that boring-ass font <br>
like u don't wanna submit this paper even though it's under the page limit <br>
like u don't feel deprived of ur artistic freedom <br>

like the institution cares about u <br>
like u gotta make every sentence what they wanna hear <br>
what do they wanna hear? tell me <br>
is anything rly objective nowadays <br>

because u see, ms. smith, <br>
discipline is one thing <br>
yet freedom of expression is another <br>

bell hooks never capitalized her name <br>
audre lorde never capitalized america <br>
tell me, where are those grammatical rules <br>
you clung onto so dearly all along? <br>

i don't care if u gave the rest of the class m&ms <br>
and not me because i skipped a step on the stairs or two <br>
i don't care if i didn't indent on my state-wide english exam <br>
because ur words were misconstrued <br>

i used to care <br>
but now i don't <br>
what changed, u might ask <br>
well ms. smith, lemme tell u smth <br>

i learned to read <br>
i learned to write <br>
i learned that in the end <br>
nobody's right <br>

i wish more educators recognized <br>
how precious a child's mind can be <br>
instead of plunging us into the facade of adulthood <br>
cuz that's all we're taught to achieve <br>

this is my world <br>
a world long overdue <br>
i'll caress it, scribble on it, shred it up<br>
and u can't tell me what to do <br>
