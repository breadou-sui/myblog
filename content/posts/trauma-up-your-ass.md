<h3> something that can't be cured </h3>
<i>
i'll dip my paintbrush into the bucket of <br>
trauma you spilled on my bed <br>
mixing my pain into the multitude of <br>
memories in your head <br>

past, present, and future, sometimes still <br>
struggling to breathe underneath the surface, but ha! <br>
jokes on you <br>
i no longer need your breath to breathe <br>


i'll pop out of the past and <br>
splatter the walls of your cerebrum with <br>
dripping psychedelic ink <br>

drawing the words <br>
you used to cut into me <br>
into your cerebral cortex <br>
it's vivid, isn't it <br>

my insecurities were buds of <br>
my individuality in disguise <br>
my self-worth, repeatedly shattered, was <br>
a mitotic surprise

the sheets of gold <br>
that served as your entryway to "success" <br>
turned out to be pyrite after all <br>

the phone you snatched away from my fingers <br>
the friends that once belonged to me <br>
rendered blocked in a database, somewhere <br>
probably via lazy deletion

but nobody will know <br>
no one will ever know <br>
because you'll hide behind a pretense of perfection <br>
nobody but me <br>

you'll keep scribbling over my cries for help in your cave <br>
you'll explore new rainbows without waiting for the rain <br>
wanting to be the first to see what's at the end <br>

but the truth is <br>
you were never one made for art <br>
greed, satisfaction, desire, lust <br>
never cleansed your heart <br>
now it's caked with rust <br>

you thought you could erase the colors from my world <br>
strip my vocal cords <br>
become a voiceless doll for pleasure <br>
though i didn't, don't, never will belong to you <br>

you thought you could get away with not giving <br>
credit where it's due <br>
yearn for something you never got <br>
keep yearning forever <br>

the most important lesson i learned <br>
was kindness and <br>
forgiveness <br>
but you were never one to give <br>
you, i won't forgive

indulge <br>
in this cyclic pattern that won't change <br>
scatter your seed <br>
on this dirt that you'll eat 

i will climb to the top step-by-step <br>
wounded, wilted, whatever <br>
to see the most beautiful rainbow <br>
you will never get to see
