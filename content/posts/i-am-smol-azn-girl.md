i am smol asian girl <br>
✂ ambient ✁ elusive ✃ lowkey ya̴͋n̵̘͛͊d̵̢͕̈́̎e̸ŕ̸̮̋e̴̱̯̗̺͎̬͔̅͐̾́̏̚  <br>
seemingly w̶a̶n̶n̶a̶b̶e̶ e-girl <br> 
with an aesthetic free of labels <br>

𝓈𝑜𝒻𝓉 chubby thighs <br>
no need for skincare <br>
genes good n bã̵͕̤d̸̙͓̿ n in-betwe̸̡̍eņ̴̔ <br>
with a lil too much hair 🤨 <br>

i like to wear my pusheen backpack <br>
and eat häagen dazs when it snows <br>
i wear skirts in the winter ❆ <br>
even though it's fucking cold ☃

i hate playing tug-of-war <br>
with my brain's fixation on numb3r5 <br>
i snuck out of my house <br>
in middle school to pay for pixels<br>

i despise smells that remind me <br>
of the rabbit dissection lab in 12th grade <br>
i vibratoed to elvis presley <br>
at my chemistry teacher's wedding ♪

i like hydrangeas cos they look fluffy <br>
like cottoncandy28, my fantage username <br>
aka squishybunni aka 冰激凌 aka faithnlove34<br>

i am good at retrosynthesis <br>
that sounded like an affirmation <br>
but it's true, believe me <br>
ask my orgo teacher if u want <br>

i cut my finger on a plant in a playground <br>
“为什么你不会写你的名字？”<br>
where we made cakes out of charcoal <br>
“你是更喜欢中国还是美国啊？”

i ate green pea scallion twists from fay da <br>
did u know they used to be $0.70 <br>
i like the coconut cream buns <br>
and 肉松包 which i thought looked hairy as a kid

i don't like coke <br>
nor do i do coke <br>
i don't like dr pepper, hot tamales <br>
teletubbies, and care bears

i like it when my <br> 
eyeliner is winged like a warped triangle <br>
i like mint turquoise and pastel pink <br>
and black and white kinks<br>

i let my superstitions get the best of me <br>
little jingling kittens followed me everywhere <br>
beneath drawers, on my backpack, in my pocket <br>
everywhere i went

i stopped keeping track of my hair colors <br>
countless tabs of manic panic, sparks, adore <br>
yes these words describe me well, but <br>
they're hair dye brands, in case you couldn't tell

that's enough of me <br>
now tell me a bit about yourself, pretty stranger ♡
