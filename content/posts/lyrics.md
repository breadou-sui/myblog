My name is A-nee SUH-way <br>
I am twenty-one years old <br>
I like to eat <br>
But I don't like it when it lingers on my body <br>

I like to take up as little space as possible <br>
I like making up my own world <br>
And the people who live inside me <br>
I like my dog, Billy <br>

I like obsessing over people <br>
And then throwing them away <br>

I like believing there's a cure <br>
But most of all, I <br>

Wasted <br>
Wasted in a cyber dimension <br>
I'm staring at the screen that you live in <br>
I'm trying to remember your name then <br>

All I had was pixel affection <br>
Pixel affection <br>
Pixel affection <br>
Pixel affection <br>

I wanna leave the world I was left in <br>
I'm trying to remember your name then <br>

There was a time when she could tell <br>
The difference between dream and life <br>

Finally (fantasy?), finally <br>
Finally, finally <br>
Finally (fantasy?), finally <br>
Finally, finally <br>

Oh no, she's waiting for no one <br>
Save your love <br>
For someone like me <br>
You don't have to be a part time, save your love <br>

Too dead inside <br>
Too dead inside <br>
Too dead... <br>

To have a sleepover <br>
To drink some apple cider <br>
Or maybe some fruit punch <br>

The bloody mess I made <br>
The love that always fades <br>
The flowers that remain <br>

I'm chasing, chasing, chasing, chasing <br>
My own shadow <br>

Who the fuck wired my mind?
