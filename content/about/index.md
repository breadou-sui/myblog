You found me. 🙂 <br>
Were you expecting a bio?

<span><i> Annie Qin Sui is a current undergraduate senior at Columbia University. She has been a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Programming in C (2x), Intro to Java (6x), and CS Theory (1x). She previously interned at Amazon as an SDE under Alexa's Secure AI Foundations (SAIF) Artifact Storage team, and will be joining Facebook (Meta) in New York as a software engineer post-graduation.

她的中文名字叫隋玉。和她家人说中文，还能用微信和她国内姐姐联系。她喜欢唱歌，听音乐，吃喝玩乐。很多人说她不像学习的样子。其实我的压力都是我自己给的。

I'm not gonna pretend that the thought of not knowing who you are doesn't scare me. You could be my student, my foe, my past mentor, my future interviewee (in which case, I wish you the best of luck!) 

Whoever you are, I hope that my blog inspires you to express your identity in whichever manner you choose.

You can email me at squishyrainbow@gmail.com, but I might not respond due to the amount of Bitcoin spam I've been getting. If you like my blog, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anniesui"> consider buying me <span style="color: #BF6DAF"> coffee ☕ </span></a>so I can keep creating this kind of content! Also, check out my secret YouTube channel (if you can find it, that is) 😜

P.S. I would be highkey honored if you nominated me for a TED talk :)
